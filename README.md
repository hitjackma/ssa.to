# SSA.to: Static Code Analysis & SyntaxFlow

> A technical blog focusing on compiler technology and static code analysis, featuring SyntaxFlow DSL for efficient security vulnerability detection.

## üéØ Overview

This website serves as a comprehensive resource for static code analysis and compiler technology, with a special focus on modernizing traditional static analysis approaches. We aim to bridge the gap between theory and practice in the field of compilation and static analysis.

## üåü Main Features

### 1. Compiler Technology Deep Dive
- Detailed exploration of three-phase compiler architecture
- In-depth coverage of frontend, middle-end, and backend compilation
